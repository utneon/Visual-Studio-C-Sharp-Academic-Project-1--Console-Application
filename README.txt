I developed this very basic Visual Studio C# console application project for C# programming language course, so because it was the first project given it's very basic and easy to understand. You may use this project free of charge MIT License or you can use it to get some basic ideas and concepts working with Arrays, ArrayLists, Writing/Reading files and building some basic Methods/Functions.

I did some quick translation from portuguese to english for a slightly better understanding on comments and code.

The application is a simulation of a multimedia library for Movies, Music and Pictures with rental system. It doesn't make sense to rent pictures and files, but this was for academic purposes as it was asked for the entire class.

Feel free to use or make any changes to it.
